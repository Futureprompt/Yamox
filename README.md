# Yamox
**_A poorly-designed and developed programming language. For your enjoyment._**

## Installation
Yamox currently isn't ready for installation. I don't know why I made this repository so early. ~~It's probably to do with the fact that I can't keep my mouth shut about it.~~

## Development
While I'm still developing the language, and making sure it actually works, I'll provide examples of what it looks like.

## FAQ
### Why?
I've always wanted to challenge myself with making a programming language. I wanted to make something simple and easy to learn. Somehow I messed that up and Yamox is more complex than *most* languages I know.
### What does Yamox mean?
It's completely made-up. It sounded cool at first. Now it sounds weird.
### Isn't .ymx taken?
Pretty much every 3-character file extension is.
### Why do we need another language?
We don't - there are literally hundreds. It's just for fun. Might be useful in some ways.
### What is with the letters?
It makes it more international! Too many languages use full english words like `while` and `function`. I thought it might be better to make a language where this isn't the case, where `while` is `w` and `function` is `s` (`f` is `for`, so I had to use something else for functions.)
